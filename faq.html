                <h3>How Do I Start on TradeRoots?</h3>
                <p>We recommend users first create an in-depth profile that demonstrates their skills, experience, and personality. From there, users can utilize Trust Networks and real-life connections to begin trading and build credibility.</p>

                <h3>How Can I Trust Other Users?</h3>
                <p>Trust and reliability are our number one priorities, and we’ve taken numerous measures to ensure them within our program. On every profile, you have access to each user’s previous exchanges, reviews, connections, and trust networks. This information allows you to gauge the quality of the user’s skills as well as know who they’ve previously worked with.</p>
                <p>For the safest experience, we recommend users engage in trades with people they have mutual connections with and those within their trust networks.</p>

                <h3>Can I Cancel a Trade?</h3>
                <p>You can cancel trades without consequence at least 12 hours before they are scheduled by navigating to the exchange page and clicking “Cancel Trade.” If you cancel a trade less than 12 hours before it occurs, the other user can mark it as a late-notice cancellation. If you receive two or more late-notice cancellations within a one-month period, it will be shown on your profile. You can appeal a late-notice cancel by contacting us.</p>
